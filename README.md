In this practice I worked on creating volunteer_organization_db.
The assignments table includes two foreign keys that link to the other tables.
I used CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE and INSERT statements and  wrapped the whole 
script in a transaction using START TRANSAcTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK for 
testing. I ran the script in MYSQL Workbench and it worked without errors. 
All three tables were created successfully and the mock ata was inserted 
correctly.
